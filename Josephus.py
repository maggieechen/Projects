# Description: This program solves what is known as the Josephus problem. There is a group of soldiers surrounded by an overwelming force. There is no hope, so they make a pact to commit suicide. They form a circle and a number n is picked from a hat. One of their names is picked at random. Beginning with the solider whose name is picked, they begin to count clockwise around the circle. Whne the count reaches n, that soldier is executed, and the count begins with the next man. The process continues so that each time the count reaches n, a man is removed from the circle. Once a soldier is removed from the circle he is no longer counted. The last soldier remaining was Josephus and instead of taking his life he joined the enemy forces. This program takes a given number n, the ordering of men in the circle, and the man from whom the count begins, to determine the order in which the men are eliminated from the circle and which man escapes. This program uses a circular linked list.
